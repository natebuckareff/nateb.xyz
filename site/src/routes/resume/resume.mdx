# Nate Buckareff

Hello, I'm Nate Buckareff. I'm a full-stack developer, entrepeneur, and life-long learner.

I specialize in helping people translate business needs into technical solutions while staying focused on the customer. This allows me to bridge between highly technical teams, designers, and project stakeholders. I am looking for roles that allow me to help organizations streamline product development by maximizing developer productivity, designing human and machine automation processes, and fearlessly tackling deep technical problems.
