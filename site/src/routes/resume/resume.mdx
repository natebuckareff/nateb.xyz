# Nate Buckareff

Hello, I'm Nate Buckareff. I'm a full-stack developer, entrepeneur, and life-long learner.

I specialize in helping people translate business needs into technical solutions while staying focused on the customer. This allows me to bridge between highly technical teams, designers, and project stakeholders. I am looking for roles that allow me to help organizations streamline product development by maximizing developer productivity (by optimizing the DX), designing human and machine automation processes, and fearlessly tackling deep technical problems.
