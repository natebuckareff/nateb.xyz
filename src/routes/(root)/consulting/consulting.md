I'm a full-stack developer currently living in Brtish Columbia, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ with over 7 years of experience building commercial products and internal tools for businesses.

I believe that the future of work is businesses and entrepeneurs connecting directly with peope who perfectly fill a niche specific to the problem needing to be solved. We don't live in that work quite yet, but persistent trends in WFH and generative AI are strong a strong indication that we are moving toward that future.

That is why I decided to pursue a non-traditional path for a full-stack software developer.

Most freelance and contract developers tend to be either: very junior or very senior and hyper-specialized. The problem is that most new business ideas are started by someone who is already has some specific knowledge that they are trying to productize. They don't need a "business consultant", but a one-man development team that is able to understand business goals and ship software.

This problem is only slightly less relevant for SMBs looking to automate their internal processes. There the options are something like:

- Pay a SaaS business for a tool that the competition is already using
- Pay an expert industry consultant to manage an outsourced development team
- Pay and manage an outsourced development team

I am the other option. I'll take the time to learn about your industry and help discover how custom software can be used to leverage your unique industry knowldge. You may have an existing pain from a legacy process or are looking to expand operations which may require automating processes.

I am proficient with the following tools and technologies:

* HTML5
* CSS
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* Bash/Shell
* Rust
* Python
* C and C++
* Node.js
* React / Preact
* tRPC
* Next.js
* SolidJS
* Flask
* Fastify
* Mobile development
* PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis
* Linux server administration
* Kubernetes
* Microsoft Azure
* Google Cloud Platform
* Amazon Web Services
* Digital Ocean, Linode, Herzter, etc

This is by no means an exhaustive list. Your project may have specific requirements that we'll discover in the planning phase.

Hosting is a common concern for clients. Many are worried about (or had direct experience with) being locked-in to a cloud hosting provider. My default approach is vendor-agnostic hosting. I will not use any tools that lock you into a specific company without first discussing, and then it's usually because of a specific business requirement.

I help clients find and leverage the free-credit programs offered by most big hosting providers. These programs can be enough to develop the initial version of a product without paying anything for hosting. And by using a vendor-agnostic architecture, moving to another provider when the credits run dry a simple process.
