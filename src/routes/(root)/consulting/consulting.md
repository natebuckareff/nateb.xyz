I'm Nate, a Canadian ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ full-stack developer with 7+ years of experience building commercial products and internal tools for businesses.

_Helping my clients deliver value to their customers is my highest priority._ I'll take the time to learn about your industry and help you discover how custom software can be used to leverage your unique knowldge. Maybe you have an existing pain from a legacy process, or you're looking to expand operations which may require automation. Or maybe you have an amazing new business idea, but are unsure where to start. Either way, [I would be happy to get in touch](/contact) and learn about your project.

I believe that the future of work is businesses and entrepeneurs connecting directly with peope who fill the niche specific to the problem. We don't live in that world quite yet, but persistent trends in WFH and generative AI are a strong indication we are moving toward that future.

That is why I decided to pursue a non-traditional path for a full-stack software developer.

Most freelance and contract developers tend to be either: very junior or very senior / hyper-specialized. The problem is that most new business ideas are started by someone who already has specific knowledge they are trying to productize. They don't need a "business consultant", but a one-man development team that is able to understand their business goals and ship software.

For small and midsize businesses looking to automate their internal processes, the options are something like:

1. Buying a SaaS tool the competition is already using
2. Hiring an expert industry consultant to manage an outsourced development team
3. Managing an outsourced development team

I am the other option.

## Hosting

A common concern for clients is hosting. Many are worried about (or have direct experience with) being locked-in to a cloud hosting provider. On the other hand, some hosting providers offer specialized services that force an application to commit to that platform.

My default approach is to build application that are easily migrated from any hosting platform. That means leveraging common open source projects that are vendor-agnostic.

I also offer the ability to get up and running quickly with a multi-cloud application that runs _across multiple hosting providers_.

I also help clients find and leverage the free-credit programs offered by most big hosting providers. These programs can be enough to develop the initial version of a product without a hosting cost.

But the bottom like is this: I will not lock you into a specific hosting company.
